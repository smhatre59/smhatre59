## Hi there 👋
### A brief Intro
-  I am currently working at [Crowdfire](https://www.crowdfireapp.com/) as a frontend developer and have worked in IT industry since 2015.  
-  I have experience in technologies like React, Node.js and ReactNative.
-  🌱 I’m currently learning web technologies, data science concepts and ways to improve my overall productivity as a developer.
-  Although I truly never understand the inner workings of complex neural networks completely their current applications have truly blown me away and I constantly try to read about new concepts in this field like an innocent child marvelling at new toys.
-  I also like writing technical articles, creating opensource projects, teaching students on weekends sometimes and help other developers in any way I possibly can. 

### Hobbies ❄️
 - In my spare time I like to play bollywood tunes of mostly romantic songs on my own guitar or piano app and share them on status updates to gain attention.
 - I used to play PC videogames since childhood a lot and still do sometimes to chill out. 
 - I read fiction/non-fiction novels on weekends so feel free to send in your suggestions :D
